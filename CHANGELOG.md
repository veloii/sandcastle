# @ai-hero/sandcastle

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a5cff39: Hide `agent` option from public API. The `agent` field has been removed from `RunOptions` and the `--agent` CLI flag has been removed from `init` and `interactive` commands. Agent selection is now hardcoded to `claude-code` internally. The agent provider system remains as an internal implementation detail.

### Patch Changes

- f11fd90: Add JSDoc comments to all public-facing type properties: `RunResult`, `LoggingOption`, and `PromptArgs`.
- 1fc5e32: Add kitchen-sink `run()` example to README with inline JSDoc-style comments on every option. Also updates the `RunOptions` table to remove the hidden `agent` field, fix the `maxIterations` default (1, not 5), fix the `timeoutSeconds` default (1200, not 900), update the `imageName` default, and add the missing `name` and `copyToSandbox` fields. Removes the removed `--agent` flag from the `sandcastle init` and `sandcastle interactive` CLI tables.
- b713226: Migrate from npm to pnpm across the project (issue #168).
  - Added `packageManager: "pnpm@10.7.0"` to `package.json`
  - Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` (replaces `package-lock.json`)
  - Updated CI and release workflows to use `pnpm/action-setup` and `pnpm` commands
  - Updated all template `main.ts` files to use `pnpm install` in `onSandboxReady` hooks
  - Updated all prompt files (`.sandcastle/` and `src/templates/`) to reference `pnpm run typecheck` and `pnpm run test`
  - Updated `README.md` development and hooks examples to use pnpm
  - Updated `InitService.ts` next-steps text to reference pnpm

- cd429c0: Replace --ff-only with regular merge for worktree merge-back (issue #162)

  When the agent finishes, Sandcastle now uses `git merge` instead of `git merge --ff-only` to integrate the temp branch back into the host branch. This allows users to make commits on the host branch while Sandcastle is running without causing merge-back failures. Fast-forward still happens naturally when the host branch hasn't moved; only the requirement that it _must_ fast-forward is removed.

- db3adec: Show run name instead of provider name in log-to-file summary (issue #160).

  When `name` is passed to `run()`, it now appears as the `Agent` value in the run summary instead of the internal provider name (`claude-code`). When no name is provided the provider name is used as before.

- df9fe6c: Surface tool calls in run logs (issues #163, #164, #165, #166).

  `parseStreamJsonLine` now returns an array of events per line. Assistant messages may produce `text` and/or `tool_call` items. Tool calls are filtered to an allowlist (Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent) with per-tool arg extraction, and displayed interleaved with agent text output. The Display service gains a `toolCall(name, formattedArgs)` method rendered as a dim-styled step in terminal mode and a plain log line in log-to-file mode.

- dbe5989: Update 'How it works' section in README to describe the worktree-based architecture, replacing the outdated sync-in/sync-out description. Also fix related references to sync-in/sync-out throughout the README.
