Hide `agent` option from public API. The `agent` field has been removed from `RunOptions` and the `--agent` CLI flag has been removed from `init` and `interactive` commands. Agent selection is now hardcoded to `claude-code` internally. The agent provider system remains as an internal implementation detail.
